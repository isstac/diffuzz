	Purpose:	PSF screening question that assesses direct exposure to someone with tuberculosis, which is a risk factor for TB exposure.;;
	Explanation:  Uses new EXIST modifier.. need to discuss with group.;;

Data:
Pos_Risk := read {ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY from CHICA} Where it Occurred Within Past 1 Year;
Neg_Risk := read {NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY from CHICA} Where it Occurred Within Past 1 Year;
PPD := read Exist {PPD from CHICA} Where it Occurred Within Past 1 Year;
//Study := read LAST {K22STUDY1};
;;
	Priority:	262;;
	Evoke:	;;
//	Urgency:	;;

Logic:
//If {Study = Control} then conclude False;

//If (Pos_Risk = True) then conclude False;
If any Pos_Risk is in ('TRAVEL TO TB ENDEMIC COUNTRY', 'TB EXPOSURE') then conclude False;

//If (Neg_Risk = True) then conclude False;
If any Neg_Risk is in ('TRAVEL TO TB ENDEMIC COUNTRY') then conclude False;

//If (PPD = True) then conclude False;
If PPD = 'POSITIVE' then conclude False;

conclude True;

Action:
write ("Has || firstname || been exposed to anyone with tuberculosis (TB) disease?");
// needs to be re-translated write("") At Spanish;
