 * other required values (like dateVoided and voidedBy) are filled in. It also makes sure the voided
 * attributes are cleared out if the voided bit is set to false. <br>
 * <br>
 * The {@link RequiredDataAdvice} class uses AOP around each method in every service to check to see
 * if its a save* method. If it is a save* method, and the object being saved implements
 * {@link Voidable}, this class is called to handle setting the {@link Voidable#setVoidedBy(User)},
 * and {@link Voidable#setDateVoided(Date)} if not set already. <br>
 * <br>
 * Note: The {@link RequiredDataAdvice} class will loop over child collections on this
 * {@link Voidable} that are themselves a {@link Voidable} and voidedBy/dateVoided are set, but
 * <b>ONLY IF</b> the voided bit was set on them as well. Using the associated void* method in the
 * service on the parent instance is preferred so that all child objects are indeed voided.
